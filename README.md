As of 2016, this repo contains tools for the finger environmental study (Movement anticipation and EEG: Implications for BCI-Robot Therapy), the finger therapy study (music glove and eeg data processing tools), the finger-emotiv study, the finger oscillation proprioception study, and is continuing to grow.
